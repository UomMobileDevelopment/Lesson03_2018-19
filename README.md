# Lesson04_2019-20


## Topics for this lesson

1. **Basics about git**  In order to continue from our previous code base we need to learn how to properly use git system. The task is to succesfully clone branch `06_Activity_Lifecycle` of the previous repository `Lesson_03_2019-20` which is [here](https://github.com/UomMobileDevelopment/Lesson_03_2019-20/tree/06_Activity_Lifecycle)

2. **Explore Activity lifecycle details from previous section** Use the context from previous section to explore and better understand the activity lifecycle details

3. **Build a simple calculator** We are going to build a simple calculator in order to explore more details about activities, listeners and layouts. Our app will support different layout for portrait/landscape orientation.

4. **Use saved Instance State knowledge** The calculator has been probably finished! But there is a bug. To see it make a calculation, change orientation and continue calculating! oops! Something needs to be fixed there!
Activity states needs to be saved between activity transitions, so we will use ``Saved Instance State`` for this. 
Please study [this](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/saving-states), [this](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/activities/activity-lifecycle.html#asem) and [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8091992/where-is-the-bundle-of-onsaveinstancestate-saved) resource. 

5. **Polishing landscape layout**. We are going to learn how to center the buttons group on landscape screen by using Guidelines
